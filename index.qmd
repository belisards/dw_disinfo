## Hi!

Data journalist from ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, experienced in human rights investigations.

Since 2013, I have collaborated with several Brazilian and international organizations, such as Witness, UNHCR, Forensic Architecture, and Bellingcat.

Here, I will present my research at the Oxford Internet Institute, developed in partnership with [**Fogo Cruzado**](https://fogocruzado.org.br/).

## Fogo Cruzado

Instituto Fogo Cruzado (Crossfire Institute) has monitored and collected data from firearm violence events in Rio de Janeiro since 2017. They currently operate in four cities.

Fogo Cruzado's human rights analysts follow online and on-the-ground sources seven days a week.

## Fact-checking gun violence 

Human rights analysts follow multiple online sources simultaneously.

If a gun violence report is identified on social media, they ask follow-up questions to the users. 

Then, they need to fact-check all reports and, if they are true, record an event in their database and provide real-time alerts.

## The needle in the haystack

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
To keep the flow of new messages manageable, restrictive search filters were used (e.g. using geographic instead of linguistic filters). However, less than half of Twitter data is geotagged, meaning many reports may have been missed.

Even so, following several multiple sources a gun violence report among ordinary text is difficult. Analysts must conciliate the demand for verifying the cases and keeping up with an unstoppable flow of new posts.

## Goals

- Train an open-source language model on analysts' interactions to detect what a gun violence report is in colloquial Brazilian Portuguese.

- Reduce signal-to-noise ratio for analysts monitoring firearm violence.

- Design an experiment to assess the model's performance in a real-world setting.

## Methods

I fine-tuned a Transformer neural network (the T in ChatGPT) using an open-source base model for Portuguese (BERTimbau) and ~30k tweet messages.

In addition to standard evaluation using holdout datasets, I integrated the model in a prototype designed to provide real-time predictions and evaluated it in real-world conditions with an experiment.

## The prototype
::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
1. Fetch new tweets using keywords and/or location and language filters.

2. The model predicts a binary classification for the message: gun violence report or ordinary text.

3. The text message and all metadata available - including the predictions - are uploaded to Airtable.

## The experiment

I conducted an experiment to evaluate the model performance in the wild: for one month, analysts from Rio de Janeiro adopted the AI-based classification to assist their online search, whereas other regions still used only fully human-made reviews. 

The experiment was evaluated through surveys, interviews, and the number of Twitter interactions with new reports by region (controlled by external factors).

## Results {.smaller}

- The model performed really well in all classification metrics (80-90% of success) when tested with holdout datasets.

- Analysts have approved and adopted the prototype as part of their standard workflow to monitor new cases;

- The experiment showed that using AI increased analysts' interactions with users reporting armed violence.


## Final considerations

- **Beyond English: language gap in AI**

- **Beyond Twitter: restrictions on social media APIs**

- **Beyond text: multimodal disinformation**
